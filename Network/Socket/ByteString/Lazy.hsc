-- Copyright   : (c) Bryan O'Sullivan 2009

-- Maintainer  : bos@serpentine.com
-- Stability   : experimental
-- Portability : POSIX, GHC
--
-- This module provides access to the BSD /socket/ interface.  This
-- module is generally more efficient than the 'String' based network
-- functions in 'Network.Socket'.  For detailed documentation, consult
-- your favorite POSIX socket reference. All functions communicate
-- failures by converting the error number to 'System.IO.IOError'.
--
-- This module is made to be imported with 'Network.Socket' like so:

-- > import Network.Socket hiding (send, sendTo, recv, recvFrom)
-- > import Network.Socket.ByteString.Lazy
-- > import Prelude hiding (getContents)

-- Sending

-- | Send data to the socket. The socket must be in a connected state.
-- Returns the number of bytes sent. Applications are responsible for
-- ensuring that all data has been sent.
--
-- Because a lazily generated 'ByteString' may be arbitrarily long,
-- this function caps the amount it will attempt to send at 4MB.  This
-- number is large (so it should not penalize performance on fast
-- networks), but not outrageously so (to avoid demanding lazily
-- computed data unnecessarily early).  Before being sent, the lazy
-- 'ByteString' will be converted to a list of strict 'ByteString's
-- with 'L.toChunks'; at most 1024 chunks will be sent.  /Unix only/.

-- | Send data to the socket.  The socket must be in a connected

-- has been sent or an error occurs.  If there is an error, an
-- exception is raised, and there is no way to determine how much data

-- Receiving

-- | Receive data from the socket.  The socket must be in a connected
-- state.  Data is received on demand, in chunks; each chunk will be
-- sized to reflect the amount of data received by individual 'recv'
-- calls.
--
-- All remaining data from the socket is consumed.  When there is no
-- more data to be received, the receiving side of the socket is shut
-- down.  If there is an error and an exception is thrown, the socket
-- is not shut down.

-- | Receive data from the socket.  The socket must be in a connected
-- state.  This function may return fewer bytes than specified.  If
-- the received data is longer than the specified length, it may be
-- discarded depending on the type of socket.  This function may block
-- until a message arrives.
--
-- If there is no more data to be received, returns an empty 'ByteString'.
recv :: Socket         -- ^ Connected socket
     -> Int64          -- ^ Maximum number of bytes to receive
     -> IO ByteString  -- ^ Data received
recv sock nbytes = chunk `liftM` N.recv sock (fromIntegral nbytes) where
  chunk k
    | S.null k  = Empty
    | otherwise = Chunk k Empty
